Review 10|Best clear whey ever|Love this! I struggle with normal whey protein so finding a decent tasting clear whey is super important for me. This tastes so amazing, not artificial at all and mixes so well. The best clear whey I've ever had.
Review 11|lekker|refreshing
"Review 12|Prima clear whey drankje|""Delicious drink and good taste!"
"Only downside is the clumping but that seems to be normal! Dissolves quite quickly."""
Review 13|Famos|Fits very well!
"Review 14|Nostalgiegeschmack|I like that the Green Apple flavor is very bold and even a bit sour! It's great as a soda; the slightly chemical taste is totally my thing."
Review 15|Perfekt :)|I find the taste of this powder very pleasant and not overpowering! It's exactly what I was looking for, a little change from the apple flavor :D
"Review 16|Gerne nochmal - oder auch noch nen 3tes Mal...|""I am very satisfied with the product."

The whey dissolves really well and the taste is very reminiscent of the instant iced tea you find in the supermarket - which I find very positive.
"Otherwise, it's currently my standard whey after training, and I've already reordered it."""

"Review 18|Exotisch gut|""Refreshing and delicious."
"A little too sweet for my taste."""
Review 19|Bester Geschmack|Simply delicious and awesome. Top!!!!!!
Review 20|Erfrischend lecker|Not as sweet as others and therefore better for thirst quenching. Grapefruit flavor is very natural.. 👍
